# Twitter Clone with SvelteKit and DaisyUI

This project is a Twitter clone built entirely using GitHub Copilot Agents with a single short prompt: "Create a SSR-based Twitter clone using Svelte and DaisyUI for styling." After the initial prompt, only minor error corrections were needed with no additional significant prompts.

*Fun fact: This project was built in approximately 15 minutes using AI assistance, and even this README was written by an AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)!*
